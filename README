"Sass for Wordpress" enables you to use Sass (Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets) in your Wordpress project.

== Description ==

"Sass for Wordpress" enables you to use Sass ([Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets](http://sass-lang.com/)) in your Wordpress project.

== Installation ==

First, you need to have the Haml gem installed on your server to use the plugin (Sass comes bundled with Haml). Please have a look at the Sass website for [installation instructions for Haml/Sass](http://sass-lang.com/download.html).

Second, your PHP version needs to be 5+ and shouldn't run in safe mode. We need to use the exec() function to run the command line tool to transform Sass into CSS.

If you're sure you have done the above, you are ready to go (syntax below)!

== Changelog ==

= 1.0 =

* Initial release.

== Usage/syntax ==

Simply refer to your Sass file by using the sass('filename') function. For instance, to use a style.sass file in your theme directory (which will be transformed into style.css), put this in your head:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="<?php echo sass('style'); ?>" type="text/css" media="screen" />
